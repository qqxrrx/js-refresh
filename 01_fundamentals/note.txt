javascript:
  high-level, object oriented multi-paradigm programming language

role of js:
  logical actions, dynamic effects for the web
  made modern web possible
  required to master it before moving on js frameworks (react, angular, vue, etc.)
  web, desktop, mobile


ECMAscript:
- ES5
- ES6/ES2015
...
- ES13/ES2022

ES6 ~ ES11 = modern javascript

external javascript files are better than inline code


in js values are either an Object or a Primitive

Primitive data types:
  Number: or floating point numbers (decimals, integers)
  String: sequence of characters (text)
  Boolean: logical only true or false, taking decisions
  Undefined: not yet defined or not yet initialized
  Null: empty value
  Symbol: unique value that cannot be changed
  BigInt: large integers too large for Number type


js is dynamic, data types are automatically determined when value is stored
value has type and not the variable
