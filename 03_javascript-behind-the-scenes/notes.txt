javascript:
  basic definition:
    high level, object oriented, multi-paradigm programming language
  specific definition:
    high level, prototype-based object-oriented, multi-paradigm, interpreted or just-in-time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded, garbage-collected programming language with first-class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model


--- high level

  no need to worry about resource management
  has abstractions to handle the work
  downside could be unoptimized code


--- garbage-collected

  automatically remove unused objects from memory


--- interpreted or just-in-time compiled

  converts code to machine code inside the javascript engine


--- multi-paradigm

  paradigm: mindset of structuring code which directs the coding style and technique
  types:
    procedural: organizing code in linear way with functions
    object oriented programming: classes
    functional programming: pure functions, high order functions, currying, composition


--- prototype-based object-oriented

  prototypal inheritance, existing blueprint already has methods which created objects inherit from


--- first-class functions

  functions are treated as variables, can pass functions to other functions


--- dynamic

  dynamically typed, don't assign data type... only known then JS executes the code
  variable types change when you assign a new type with a few exceptions


--- single-threaded

  concurrency model is single thread (can only do one task at a time)


--- non-blocking event loop

  event loop execute at background thread and then returns it to the main thread once it's finished
